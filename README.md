COVID-19 HTTP API Server with a little twist

## API list

## How to run

## Features
- [ ] Database data caching. since historical COVID-19 (usually) does not
change, there is little reason to refetch from the API everytime someone hits
our API. Therefore, we store it in a SQLite database.
- [ ] Invalidate database entry. If we would like to, we can refetch the data
in the database by an additional parameter.

## Potential issues and limitations

## Future Ideations
